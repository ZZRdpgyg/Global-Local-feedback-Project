Investigating the predictive cortical feedback processing from near and far contextual information. (3T-fMRI)

Research questions:
1. Whether the visual prediction is based on the Proximity or based on Task.
2. Whether contextual information from a far area will be influenced by information from a near area.

Hypothesis: 
1. Contextual information from near surrounding area is fed back more to non-stimulated visual area compared with far area.
2. Cortical feedback processing of contextual information from far area will be weaken by the inconsistent contextual information from near area.
